I bought Anyltics with a proved model, customers and a revenue stream (~$150 MRR). I have built many websites, but I decided I would do things differently this time around. I can already say this is my most successful project yet. I have created a handful of attempted start-ups and realized one my major weakness is keeping the momentum going, so I figured I needed to get to a point where the momentum is already going.

What I always fail to find is product market fit with whatever idea I am working on. This has been the major momentum killer for me. I also like to go overboard on tech stacks and using the newest and shinest javascript framework for my projects, with buying an already made project I don't have this issue. As much of a blessing in disguise that is, it is also a curse as I am forced to live with the previous developers choice. In this case, the backend is [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (PHP framework I haven't use before), a database I am super familiar with: MYSQL, deployed and maintained via cPanel, which I am very unfamilar with. Very trivial issues, as what is more important is that it's running and I can channel my motivation on marketing and adding new features.

One of those new features is the very blog you are reading this on. In the spirt of keeping the momentum going and using the path of least resistance, I decided to write this using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and deploying on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Both Products I can quickly ship on, as the 1 rainy Saturday it took me to build this blog can attest to.

With the blog being one aspect of marketing my focus is on, the other is giving Anlytics a proper launch. So far, there has been no big launch on any sites as the current users and growth have been completely organic. If you have every followed [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) or the highly inspirational [Peter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio?ref=levels.io), You'll know a solid launch is everything. Therefore my focus is creating the content that will be put on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Reddit](https://reddit.com).

One avenue I really like some solo-developers are going down is being transparent with all their business metrics and enlisting in [Open Startups](https://openstartup.tm/). This is also another feature/marketing system I am currently working on, utilizing the same stack as this blog, which you can find at [Open Anlytics](https://open.anlytics.co).

I am aware that buying a business is no guarantee that the project will be successful long-term and I am not saying everyone should go down this path, but I feel this is the better option for me. I am fortunate enough to have the resources to make a purchase and the technical knowledge to push features, so this is the best option for me. Momentum is still on my side and excited every day to work on this.
